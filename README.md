Modular Unstreamlined Starship Elements (MUSE)

# The Flow

The game is centered around action. As soon as you enter, there's a pirate to fight off, or a trader to trade with, or an alien to try to interact with. 

This could make for a fast-paced and dynamic experience. The player is always engaged, dealing with new situations as soon as they jump into a new system. It keeps things fresh and exciting. Each system could have a "theme" or "event pool" to draw from, so that even though the events are random, they fit the narrative vibe you're going for.

# The Storyboards

## Map View
A simplified map view: the center is your current star, and then three or four tram lines extend out wards to your possible destination stars.  There’s no clutter, and no fuss: just your flight plan based on your next move.  The map view only shows your next move, not the whole map.  

The Traveller map could give the player a broader sense of where they are in the universe. It's a strategic layer for planning, but not too much of a safety net, maintaining the uncertainty.

As a step after resupply, it could also tie into the idea that, after all the action, the player takes a moment to plan and reconsider their next move. It feels very "in-character" for the journey itself, and it reinforces the feeling of being part of a larger, ongoing adventure.


* Each destination could display key information: distance, risk level, faction presence, or a vague hint about potential events (“Unstable Signals Detected” or “Frequent Trade Activity”).
* A shield icon for patrol activity.
* A skull icon for high-risk systems (pirates or separatists).
* A glowing crate for trade opportunities.
* A swirl for alien activity or anomalies.

## Travel View 
In the second Storyboard, we have the travel view, which shows your ship in profile. Maybe you accelerate, maybe you just jump to your destination and that’s it.  

You might have interactions in this view:
* Traders: Offer unique goods, trades, or questionable deals.
* Scouts: Provide intel on nearby systems or warnings.
* Aliens: Puzzles, communication challenges, or unexpected attacks.
* Patrol Vessels: Scan for contraband, enforce faction laws, or demand bribes.
* Hostiles: if diplomacy fails, then you progress to Combat View directly. ("Surrender your cargo, or we'll make space debris out of you!")

## Combat View
This is the Travel View with attackers there, and you interact by shooting at them and, if you have one, maneuvering the fighter.  

## Dock View
The Travel View with a space dock taking up one side of the screen, which shows your ship docked there.  Resupply, repair, upgrade/gear up, and then go along your merry way.

This is key! The idea of docking with a station not just for repairs but for upgrading and gearing up opens a lot of doors for customization. Perhaps there could be resource management involved, where players need to choose between saving money for a massive upgrade or buying consumables to prepare for an upcoming fight. It’ll add a layer of strategy to the game.

# Your Ship
Your ship is highly modular, so you can swap parts and add new ones easily and visibly to your ship -- including adding a little fighter or lander to expand your capabilities a bit.  The ship is also pretty blocky, which means graphics don't have to be too svelte.

This could really tie into the player's sense of ownership and agency over the journey. The ship's blocky design makes it easier to handle in terms of development, but also adds personality. It could become a central part of the game's narrative, where each new part added tells a story. The fighter/lander addition could make players feel like they’re preparing for a real adventure, with different gameplay elements based on their ship's configuration.
